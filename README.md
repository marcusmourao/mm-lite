## Project architecture

### Stack
 - [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org)
 - [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
 - [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/)

### /api
This directory contains all the application logic that I would put in a service on the backend. All business rules are in that directory and there are integration tests to validate the flows.

### /application
Directory responsible for containing all application logic. In this directory there are tree kind of modules:
- lib: Interface with apis
- components: Components with application business rules
- module-web: Components that will be the application pages

In these modules I am using [shallowMount](https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/api/#shallowmount) to make unit tests

### /assets
This directory contains all the variables used by the design system of application

### /components
Directory that contains all the components that make up the application's design system.
These components have no business rules and are highly reusable.
This module was tested using [mount](https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/api/#mount) to guarantee the functionality of the components with the DOM.

### /core
Utility classes to standardize data manipulation.
In this directory I created the `money` module to handle money and the` product` module to handle products

### /layouts
Directory generated by Nuxt.js that groups the application's layouts

### /pages
Directory generated by Nuxt.js that groups the application pages

### /scripts
Scripts to automate tasks

 - build-docker-image.sh: Build the application's Docker image
 - release.sh: Release the project on github
 
### /tests
Utility functions to facilitate testing
